# Instructions
### Requirements
This app was created using the React framework for the front-end and python Flask backend. You will need the 
following libraries to run it:
1. Make sure you have a recent version of Node installed (https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. You also need to have Python version>=3.6 installed.
2. Clone this repo onto your local machine. 

### Start the application
3. This step should install all the node and python dependencies,
   and also start the server. \
Open a terminal and navigate to the project root. \
OS X and Linux machines: Run `chmod 777 build.sh`, followed by `./build.sh`. \
Windows users: Run the `cmd` program as administrator, navigate to project root, type in `install.bat` and press Enter. 

4. The final few lines of the terminal output should indicate that the server is up and running, with a message along the lines of `Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`.
2. In your browser (preferably Chrome), navigate to `localhost:8080`. This should display the landing page. 
3. Currently, I have the preprocessed data for Pride and Prejudice. Click on the `Load Files` button
 and navigate to the `data/` folder from the project root. Select the `.txt` file you want to annotate.
4. The tool should display the current status of the file!  
There is also a draft version of the instructions page (click on the `Instructions` link) that specify how to 
use the tool. 
5. Close the browser window and kill the terminal process (CTRL + C) to exit.
