    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Welcome! The purpose of this tool is to annotate quotations within a text. We are collecting the following data for each quote:
    <ul>
        <li>Type of quote (implicit, anaphoric or explicit). Examples of each are provided below:
            <pre>
                "I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy." <b><i>(Implicit)</i></b>
                "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit." <b><i>(Anaphoric)</i></b>
                "But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."<b><i>(Explicit)</i></b>
            </pre>

        </li>
        <li>
            Speaker of the quote.
        </li>
        <li>Addressee (who is being spoken to?)</li>
        <li>The referring expression (what indicates the speaker/addressee?). Note that implicit quotes don't have a referring expression.</li>
        <li>Mentions withing the quote, and who it refers to (eg, "<b>She</b> told me <b>Rob</b> was ill."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider the following snippet: </p>
    <pre>
        "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
        Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
        "But it is," returned she "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
    </pre>
    <p>Suppose we are annotating the second quote of the above snippet. Then the data we wish to obtain is the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Speaker: </b> Mrs. Bennet</li>
        <li><b>Addresee: </b>Mr. Bennet</li>
        <li><b>Referring expression: </b>returned she</li>
        <li><b>Mentions: </b>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Mrs. Long: </i>Mrs. Long</li>
                <li><i>she: </i>Mrs. Long</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Annotation Tool Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li>From the landing page, click the "Choose files" button. Navigate to the <code>'data/'</code> folder of the root directory and choose "text.txt".</li>
    <li>The selected text, along with a list of initial characters will load on the main page.</li>
    <li>
        The main components of the tool are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tabs: </b> There are two tabs, Quotes and Mentions, on the top right of the text area. You can click on each of them to switch between
                annotating quote information (i.e, type, speaker, addressee and referring expression) and mention information (referred entity).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Highlighted text: </b> An initital set of quotes and mentions have been automatically extracted and highlighted in the text area. <i>Note that
            these may not be accurate or complete.</i> Please ensure you are annotating the correct portion of the text.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Character List: </b> The leftmost partition contains a list of characters and their aliases that have also been automatically extracted. <i>Note that
                these may not be accurate or complete.</i> You can add/delete both character names as well as their aliases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Information collection: </b> When you click on a highlighted quote or mention, the middle partition will display information and instructions
                to facilitate the annotation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Save Progress: </b> Please ensure you are continually saving your annotations to file. <b>If you close the tab or refresh the page withour saving
            progress, all annotation information will be lost.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reload: </b> Click on this button <b>after saving</b> to reload a new file to annotate.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Highlights: Color codes</h2>
<p>As you progress through the annotation task, the color of the quotations/mentions change to indicate the phase of annotation you are in. The following list
describes them for quotes, but is equally applicable to mentions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Yellow:</b> This is an identified quote. It has not yet been annotated.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Grey: </b> This is a quote that is currently <i>selected</i> to be annotated.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Green: </b> This is a quote that has been <i>confirmed</i> for current annotation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Blue: </b> This quote has been annotated.
    </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="process">
<h2>Annotation Process</h2>
<p>(Replace "quote" with "mention" wherever applicable.)</p>
<p>A quote needs to be identified before it can be annotated. To identify a portion of the text as a quote, simply select that portion with your cursor. </p>
    <p>To start annotating an identified quote, proceed as follows: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the span of text that has been highlighted. It should appear in the middle parition of the tool, under "Current selection".</li>
    <li>Multiple quotes can be annotated at the same time. To add more quotes to the current selection, simply click on them.
        To remove a selected quote, click on it again.</li>
    <li>Click the "OK" button to confirm the current selection. The annotation fields should appear below.</li>
    <li><b>Quote type: </b> Select the correct option (Implicit, Anaphoric, or Explicit) from the radio-buttons.</li>
    <li><b>Speaker selection: </b> Each quote is assumed to have one speaker. Click the <code>Edit</code> button to select the speaker.
    The character list on the right will change it's appearance to display selectable radio-buttons next to each character. Check the radio button for the
    correct speaker, and click on the <code>Submit</code> button for Speaker. You will see the selected character has been identified as the speaker. </li>
    <li><b>Addressee selection: </b> Each quote may have multiple addressees. Click the <code>Edit</code> button to select them.
        The character list on the right will change it's appearance to display selectable checkboxes next to each character. Check the checkbox for the
        correct addressee(s), and click on the <code>Submit</code> button. You will see the selected character(s) displayed as addressee(s). </li>
    <li><b>Referring expression: </b> This field will only appear for Anaphoric and Explicit quotes. To select the expression, first click on the <code>Edit</code> button.
        Then select the correct portion of the text from the text-area on the right, and click <code>Submit</code>. The selected text will be displayed as the referring
        expression.
    </li>
    <li><b>For mentions: </b>
        The annotation for mentions consists only of selecting the referred entities from the character list on the left. This is similar to the Addressee annotation.
    </li>
    <li><b>SAVE YOUR PROGRESS! </b> By clicking on the <code>Save Progress</code> button.</li>
    <li>If any part of the text was incorrectly identified by us as being a mention or a quote, please remove it by selecting the text and clicking the
    <code>Clear</code> button instead of <code>OK</code></li>
</ol>
