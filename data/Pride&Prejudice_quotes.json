A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'

But, my\n     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\n     obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour\n     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\n     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but\n     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\n     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When\n     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;\n     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said\n     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so\n     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\n     cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\n     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\n     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at\n     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\n     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\n     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\n     duplicity in all this.

The first mentioned\n     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached\n     Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in\n     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,\n     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.\n     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of\n     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who\n     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who\n     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,\n     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could\n     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But\n     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\n     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in\n     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their\n     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is\n     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The\n     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I\n     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\n     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other\n     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the\n     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a\n     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that\n     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made\n     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that\n     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general\n     expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,\n     of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then\n     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had\n     ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and\n     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any\n     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the\n     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with\n     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have\n     been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make\n     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such\n     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n     unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity\n     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given\n     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her\n     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was\n     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will\n     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually\n     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be\n     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial\n     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to\n     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged\n     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my\n     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of\n     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to\n     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to\n     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes\n     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's\n     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that\n     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed\n     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by\n     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst\n     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your\n     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to\n     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally\n     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to\n     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that\n     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was\n     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me\n     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\n     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\n     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His\n     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\n     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible\n     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\n     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly\n     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to\n     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and\n     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have\n     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it\n     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your\n     sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\n     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has\n     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment\n     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\n     himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against\n     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,\n     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for\n     having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the\n     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is\n     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\n     conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as\n     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant\n     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is\n     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough\n     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this\n     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,\n     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more\n     to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's\n     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have\n     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more\n     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only\n     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my\n     family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but\n     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one\n     witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very\n     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the\n     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his\n     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on\n     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore\n     liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own\n     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\n     been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not\n     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always\n     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the\n     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.\n     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think\n     of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the\n     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge\n     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man\n     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of\n     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.\n     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.\n     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\n     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\n     real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to\n     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it\n     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his\n     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a\n     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became\n     vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own\n     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these\n     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally\n     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\n     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\n     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n     benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,\n     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\n     be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than\n     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to\n     accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a\n     clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all\n     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could\n     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\n     thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I\n     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\n     society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his\n     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all\n     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\n     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied\n     to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he\n     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were\n     exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would\n     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there\n     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other\n     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered\n     father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to\n     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.\n     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his\n     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\n     to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every\n     appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But\n     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I\n     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce\n     me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no\n     doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my\n     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel\n     Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from\n     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last\n     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;\n     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there\n     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.\n     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by\n     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\n     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his\n     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe\n     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but\n     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n     herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\n     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea\n     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\n     a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt\n     and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings\n     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left\n     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from\n     her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my\n     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot\n     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a\n     strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.\n     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\n     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\n     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n     towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to\n     be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing\n     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and\n     suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly\n     wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then\n     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.\n     For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more\n     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our\n     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of\n     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\n     with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of\n     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\n     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may\n     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find\n     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course\n     of the morning.

An express came at twelve last night, just as we were\n     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was\n     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,\n     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not\n     seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a\n     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that\n     his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I\n     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)\n     marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,\n     for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother\n     is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,\n     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must\n     forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as\n     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\n     eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must\n     have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason\n     to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,\n     informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be\n     long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make\n     it out, but I hardly know what I have written.", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1192": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\n     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\n     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\n     for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\n     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\n     Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia\n     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for\n     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.\n     Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day\n     before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\n     letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to\n     Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief\n     that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which\n     was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off\n     from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to\n     Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed\n     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them\n     from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen\n     to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making\n     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into\n     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at\n     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such\n     people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he\n     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner\n     most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and\n     Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my\n     dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,\n     but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it\n     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to\n     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design\n     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,\n     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to\n     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their\n     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he\n     feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill\n     and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but\n     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life\n     saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\n     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot\n     wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\n     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock\n     is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so\n     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I\n     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,\n     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging\n     you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and\n     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have\n     still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to\n     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What\n     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress\n     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest\n     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again\n     to-morrow evening.

He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,\n     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be\n     more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of\n     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\n     various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\n     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And\n     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances\n     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,\n     according to his information. He has given in all his debts; I hope\n     at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\n     all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\n     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from\n     Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,\n     before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully\n     remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1382": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "E.

I must confess myself\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\n     Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_\n     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\n     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing\n     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed\n     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\n     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\n     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\n     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\n     as _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that\n     he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that\n     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia\n     once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\n     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting\n     for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being\n     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well\n     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,\n     to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his\n     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath\n     him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character\n     was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on\n     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n     disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to\n     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another\n     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,\n     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\n     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n     found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in\n     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n     street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n     offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\n     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of\n     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\n     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,\n     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the\n     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone. He\n     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future\n     situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go\n     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n     nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\n     sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,\n     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation\n     must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to\n     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\n     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.\n     Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\n     against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,\n     for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more\n     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\n     Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was\n     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\n     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner\n     could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that\n     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next\n     morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could\n     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\n     seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not\n     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a\n     gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your\n     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they\n     had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and\n     then _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon\n     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor\n     was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real\n     defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many\n     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was\n     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do\n     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your\n     uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it\n     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman\n     or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced\n     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,\n     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\n     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your\n     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an\n     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give\n     the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther\n     than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,\n     what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,\n     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,\n     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\n     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character\n     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_\n     reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that\n     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.\n     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no\n     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and\n     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,\n     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\n     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth\n     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was\n     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the\n     wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again\n     on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n     enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\n     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\n     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever\n     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\n     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\n     far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\n     have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\n     pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more.\n     The children have been wanting me this half hour.

She wrote even\nto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her\nformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was\naffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\nher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\n\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was\nas sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.\n\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\nto Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden\nremoval was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\nmeeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\n\nMrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good\nhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.\nNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\nlikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him\nto herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\nwithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\nfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\nadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\nthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\nPemberley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\nrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she\nafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed.\nI wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment\nof her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was\nlucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in\nso unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\ninvariably silly.\n\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\ndrew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. He delighted in\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\n\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\n_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\nsisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\nto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\n\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\ntemper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\nignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's\nsociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\n\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\nmuch reluctance.\n\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\nthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\nthing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\nto make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\nfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\nif not by himself, such a hope was cherished.
