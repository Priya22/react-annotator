The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\nhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\nhim with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.

Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\nto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\napprove of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\npeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\ntwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "463": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said Mrs. Bennet, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "464": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "465": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "466": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "467": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "468": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "469": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "470": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "471": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "472": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "473": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said Mr. Bennet, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "474": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "475": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nMr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.

The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had\ngiven him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\nclergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\n\nHaving now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\na wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\npart.\n\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\nof an hour's t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "478": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\n\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.\n\nLydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\ngo.\n\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\nwere immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,\nand nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin\nin a shop window, could recal them.\n\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\nthey had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\nMr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,\nand he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,\nall wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of\nwanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\nthe pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\nWhat could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know.\n\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\nMr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\nPhilips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\ninvitation.\n\nMrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself however might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham\nappeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "479": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\n\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\nbehaviour than her sister.\n\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\nPhilips's manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\nutterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed\nto his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\nattention in the whole course of his life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\naunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\nthe house.\n\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\nwith the housekeeper's room.\n\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The\ngentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\ngentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\nMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\n\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.\n\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the\nyoung ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a\nkind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most\nabundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\n\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her\nin return, by sitting down to whist.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "480": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said he, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "481": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " Mrs. Philips was\nvery thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\n\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.

Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was\ntherefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to\nhear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to\nbe told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\neven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.

The two ladies were delighted to see\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\n\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's\nlooks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,\ndepended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though\nthey each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.\nWickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\na ball was at any rate, a ball.

She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth however did not chuse to\ntake the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\n\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,\nfor from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and\nMonday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's\npleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "553": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to\nmake.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to\nWickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\nturned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly\nsurmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality\nprovoked her.\n\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to\nthe oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\nnotice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;\nthey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\naware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\npartner for a couple of dances can give.

She saw her in idea settled in\nthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\ncould bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\nopenly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be\nsoon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.\nBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of\nthe match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\nbut three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\nshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\nchance of it.\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.

The expression\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\nsteady gravity.\n\nAt length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\nElizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she\nwatched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\namongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\nbegan another.

That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\nHe assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\nher, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\nthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\nher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\ngood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\n\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak.

Mrs. Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\nlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\nrest, and talked only to each other.

His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\nhe was the admirer of some one else.

March was to take\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,\nand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\nas well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was\nnovelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her\na peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly,\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of\nspending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became\nperfect as plan could be.\n\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\n\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\nopinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,\nthere was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her\nto him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,\nthat whether married or single, he must always be her model of the\namiable and pleasing.\n\nHer fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think\nhim less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good\nhumoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that\ncould be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight\nas the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had\nknown Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the\nwonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn\nout like his information.\n\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\nas to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\nthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\nwhose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\nfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\n\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\nher minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\nhope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\nacquaintance.\n\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "802": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " she added, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "803": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "804": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "805": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "806": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "807": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "808": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "809": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "810": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "811": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "812": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " cried Elizabeth, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "813": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "814": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "815": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "816": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "817": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said Mrs.\nGardiner, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "818": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.

Elizabeth\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,\nthe house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every\nthing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at\nthe door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a\nshort gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole\nparty. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the\nsight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest\npleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when\nshe found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her\ncousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility\nwas just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate\nto hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then,\nwith no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,\ntaken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he\nwelcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble\nabode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.\n\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\nevery thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend\nthat she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr.\nCollins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\nwhich certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\nCharlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every\narticle of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to\ngive an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,\nMr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large\nand well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.\nTo work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and\nElizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked\nof the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as\nmuch as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross\nwalk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he\nasked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\nbeauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction,\nand could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But\nof all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom\ncould boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,\nafforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly\nopposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well\nsituated on rising ground.\n\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,\nbut the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\nprobably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every\nthing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of\nwhich Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\nCharlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\nforgotten.\n\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\nin, observed,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "821": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "822": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " added\nCharlotte, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "823": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "824": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\ntelling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\nElizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon\nCharlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\nand composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\npass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\nRosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\nconfusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up\nstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.

She had heard nothing of\nLady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she\nthought she could witness without trepidation.\n\nFrom the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\nthe servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,\nher daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\nwhich he would have thought necessary.\n\nIn spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\nawed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\ncomposedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with\nstrongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air\nwas not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to\nmake her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered\nformidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so\nauthoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.\nWickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the\nday altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had\nrepresented.\n\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her\nbeing so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\nher eyes.\n\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,\nto admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its\nbeauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much\nbetter worth looking at in the summer.\n\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\nand all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\nhad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\nher ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\nnothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\nalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir\nWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\ngave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\na novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\nbetween Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\ndinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\nMiss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she\nwere indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\ngentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\nsubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\nher judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,\nas to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be\nregulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\nbeneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\noccasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\nMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\nthe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\npretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\nmother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\nquestions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then\nobserved,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "839": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " turning to Charlotte, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "840": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "841": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "842": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "843": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "844": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "845": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "846": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "847": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "848": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "849": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "850": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "851": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "852": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\nbeen the case.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "853": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "854": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "855": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "856": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "857": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "858": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "859": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said her Ladyship, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "860": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "861": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " replied Elizabeth smiling, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "862": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "863": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "864": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\nexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\nwas employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her\nfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\nand noble names.\n\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\nthe tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\ngratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\narrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\nCollins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As\nsoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\ncousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\nfor Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\nsatisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's\npraise into his own hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nSir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough\nto convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of\nher possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met\nwith. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings\nto driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he\nwent away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin\nby the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and\ndinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading\nand writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which\nfronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\nElizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\nthe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\npleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\nmuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\n\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\nalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\na few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\nprevailed on to get out.\n\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\nhours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\nout that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\n\nElizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the\ncommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\nMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\nquarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\nthem into harmony and plenty.\n\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card\ntable in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of\nthe first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of\nthe neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach. This\nhowever was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\ncomfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\nshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\n\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\nby Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\nMiss Lucas and herself.\n\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\nin order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow\nas the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\nintelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\nrespects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\nhis uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when\nMr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\nthem from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\ninto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "865": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\ncurtseyed to him, without saying a word.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\nway, and after a moment's pause, added,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "866": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\nsubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\naway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\ntheir engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\nhouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\nalmost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\nof either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\nat the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\nonly seen at church.\n\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\nthe party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had\nmoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\nspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\nwell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a\nwhile shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\nscruple to call out,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "867": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "868": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said he, when no longer able to avoid\na reply.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "869": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "870": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said Lady\nCatherine; ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "871": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "872": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " he replied, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "873": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "874": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made\nno answer.\n\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.

All field sports were over. Within doors there\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\nalways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\nformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind.\n\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\nFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself\nseriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.\n\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\n\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nMore than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly\nmeet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that\nshould bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever\nhappening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a\nfavourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was\nvery odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful\nill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not\nmerely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he\nactually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of\nlistening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre\nthat he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in\nbeing at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.\nand Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her\nnot perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever\nshe came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words\nseemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?\nShe supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what\nmight arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was\nquite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the\nParsonage.\n\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\nwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\nshe saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.

That he had been concerned in the measures\ntaken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\nhad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\narrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.

Elizabeth\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\nand a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\n\nShe could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that\nhis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\nthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\nmean to be unhappy about him.\n\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\ndoor bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\nthe evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But\nthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\nroom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\nthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said\nnot a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an\nagitated manner, and thus began,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "964": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nElizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,\nimmediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides\nthose of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the\nsubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\nits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had\nalways opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed\ndue to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\nrecommend his suit.\n\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\nreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\nall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of\nall his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\nhis hand.

That she should receive an offer of\nmarriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for\nso many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all\nthe objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her\nsister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,\nwas almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously\nso strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his\nshameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his\nunpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,\nand the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his\ncruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\n\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\nCatherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\nCharlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\nsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing\nelse, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\nshe turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed\none of the gates into the ground.\n\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\nwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\nedged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.\nDarcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now\nnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\nher name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in\na voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\ngate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,\nwhich she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "987": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "--And then, with a\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\nsight.\n\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\nElizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\nquite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise\nfull.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\nfrom Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n\n     ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "988": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned\n     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached\n     Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in\n     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,\n     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.\n     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of\n     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who\n     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who\n     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,\n     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could\n     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But\n     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\n     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in\n     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their\n     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is\n     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The\n     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I\n     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\n     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other\n     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the\n     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a\n     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that\n     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made\n     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that\n     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general\n     expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,\n     of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then\n     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had\n     ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and\n     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any\n     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the\n     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with\n     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have\n     been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make\n     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such\n     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n     unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity\n     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given\n     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her\n     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was\n     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will\n     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually\n     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be\n     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial\n     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to\n     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged\n     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my\n     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of\n     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to\n     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to\n     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes\n     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's\n     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that\n     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed\n     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by\n     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst\n     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your\n     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to\n     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally\n     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to\n     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that\n     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was\n     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me\n     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\n     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\n     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His\n     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\n     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible\n     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\n     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly\n     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to\n     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and\n     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have\n     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it\n     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your\n     sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\n     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has\n     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment\n     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\n     himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against\n     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,\n     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for\n     having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the\n     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is\n     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\n     conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as\n     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant\n     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is\n     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough\n     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this\n     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,\n     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more\n     to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's\n     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have\n     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more\n     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only\n     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my\n     family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but\n     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one\n     witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very\n     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the\n     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his\n     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on\n     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore\n     liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own\n     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\n     been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not\n     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always\n     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the\n     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.\n     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think\n     of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the\n     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge\n     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man\n     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of\n     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.\n     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.\n     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\n     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\n     real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to\n     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it\n     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his\n     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a\n     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became\n     vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own\n     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these\n     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally\n     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\n     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\n     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n     benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,\n     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\n     be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than\n     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to\n     accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a\n     clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all\n     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could\n     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\n     thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I\n     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\n     society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his\n     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all\n     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\n     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied\n     to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he\n     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were\n     exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would\n     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there\n     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other\n     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered\n     father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to\n     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.\n     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his\n     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\n     to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every\n     appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But\n     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I\n     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce\n     me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no\n     doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my\n     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel\n     Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from\n     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last\n     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;\n     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there\n     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.\n     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by\n     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\n     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his\n     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe\n     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but\n     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n     herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\n     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea\n     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\n     a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt\n     and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings\n     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left\n     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from\n     her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my\n     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot\n     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a\n     strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.\n     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\n     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\n     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n     towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to\n     be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing\n     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and\n     suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly\n     wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then\n     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.\n     For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more\n     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our\n     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of\n     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\n     with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of\n     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\n     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may\n     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find\n     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course\n     of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\n\n     ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "989": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\nits contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\nand steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\nprejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of\nwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which\nhardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing\nwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\nsense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's\ninsensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of\nthe real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have\nany wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had\ndone which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It\nwas all pride and insolence.\n\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when\nshe read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "990": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "--and when she had\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.\n\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\nwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\nown words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to\nthe will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\nwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\nnot err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\nBut every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to\nrender Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\nMr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\nentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\npersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to\nhis real character, had information been in her power, she had never\nfelt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to\nrecollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of\nintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.\nDarcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those\ncasual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy\nhad described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no\nsuch recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before\nher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\nsubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After\npausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to\nread. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,\nreceived some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\nFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was\nreferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam\nhimself--from whom she had previously received the information of his\nnear concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no\nreason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\nat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never\nhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\ncousin's corroboration.\n\nShe perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation\nbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\nthe very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been every where\ndiscussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.\nDarcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the\nfather, would always prevent his exposing the son.\n\nHow differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!\nHis attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\nincautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\nand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\nacquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him\nof irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was\nesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of\nhis sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. That had\nhis actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\nevery thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\nthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\nas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\n\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\nprejudiced, absurd.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "991": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " she cried.--", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "992": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation\n_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\ngive in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally\nunsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help\nremembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she\ndeny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's\nfeelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a\nconstant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\nsensibility.\n\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\nmentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\nfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\nthan on hers.\n\nThe compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed,\nbut it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\nself-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that\nJane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she\nhad ever known before.\n\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\nvariety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,\nand reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\nso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her\nat length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of\nappearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\nreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\n\nShe was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\ncalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take\nleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\ntill she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in\nmissing him; she really rejoiced at it.

To Rosings he then\nhastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,\nimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\nhaving them all to dine with her.\n\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her\nfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\nladyship's indignation would have been.

Reflection must be\nreserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\nas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,\nin which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\nrecollections.\n\nMr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\nstudied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\nshe was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\nfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\nthe unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\nirritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for\never.\n\nAnxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.\nDarcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good\nopinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was\nproved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,\nunless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his\nfriend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so\ndesirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for\nhappiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own\nfamily!\n\nWhen to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\nseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\n\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\nher stay, as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\nthere; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\n\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\nand Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her\nhand to both.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1006": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said he, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1007": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.

This invaluable friend was a\nvery young woman, and very lately married.

It was not\nin her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.\nShe was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over\nunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\ndisposition.\n\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\nfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\nunited volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of\nfancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She\nsaw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at\npresent unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\nand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\nofficers at once.\n\nHad she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\nsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\nsame. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\nmelancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there\nhimself.\n\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\ncontinued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving\nhome.\n\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\nan affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified\nand her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\n\nOn the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined\nwith others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\ndisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\nenquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\n\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\nhim often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,\nasked her how she had liked him.

The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.\n\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\nand impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there\nwas every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous\nhappiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\nof her sisters were uttered without being heard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nHad Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\ncomfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\nof good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\nesteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of\ndomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\nimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\n\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\nfather's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\nstrongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils\narising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly\nused, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\neven if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\nabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\nsister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around\nthem, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\nfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering\nplace and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been\nsometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward\nwith impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\nfor all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her\nmother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in\nthe scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1108": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " thought she, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1109": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nWhen Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\nalways very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\ncamp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less\nto be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\ntoo full of lines under the words to be made public.\n\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\nhumour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore\na happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\nback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June\nKitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\ntears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by\nthe following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\nmention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious\narrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in\nMeryton.\n\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast\napproaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\npresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\ncounty, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\nher curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\nDovedale, or the Peak.\n\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\nand all was soon right again.\n\nWith the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.

It was a large, handsome, stone\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\nwoody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\nwere neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\nwonder at her being where she was.\n\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\nwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\ndistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\nit, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\ntaking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to\nbe seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable\nto the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration\nof his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\nsplendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1117": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " thought she, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1118": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "--recollecting\nherself,--", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1119": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\n\nShe longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really\nabsent, but had not courage for it.

In the former were many good paintings;\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\nDarcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\nalso more intelligible.\n\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\nof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\nwhen he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in\nearnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\ngallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\nfather's life time.\n\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\nsensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\nconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of\ngood or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\nforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\nstood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\nupon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\ngratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.\n\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\nthey returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\n\nAs they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\nsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\n\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\nof perfect civility.\n\nShe had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\nreturned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the\nalteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\nuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\nimpropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few\nminutes in which they continued together, were some of the most\nuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\nenquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.\n\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\nleave.\n\nThe others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\nfeelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\nvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\nthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\ndisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\nshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\nor, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\ndiscrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\nagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\nstrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her\nfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\nnever had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\nWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when\nhe put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to\naccount for it.\n\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\nto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\nwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\nher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\ncomposure.\n\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\nascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\nof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\nthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\nmiles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\ncircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\nhanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\nthe scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\nthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\nit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\nabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\nmet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,\nthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\npoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\nbut she had not got beyond the words ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1158": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " and ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1159": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " when\nsome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\nPemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.

Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had\nsome relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\nhis taste, or his good manners.\n\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\nwalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\nwonder.

In\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\nany thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\nintercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.\n\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\narrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\ncurricle, driving up the street.

Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\na quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\nElizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\nat her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she\ndreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\nher favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks\nof enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.\n\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.\n\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\n\nThey had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\nElizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she\nstill felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the\nunaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her\nagain. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,\nand looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever\ndone.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\neach with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from\nthose enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\nit was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\nevident enough.\n\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\nwas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\nhow ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a\nlike manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that\nas he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though\nthis might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour\nto Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared\non either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was\nsoon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they\nparted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of\nJane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that\nmight lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a\nmoment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had\nsomething of real regret, that it ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1179": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " and, before she could reply, he added, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1180": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,\nwhether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the\nquestion, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner\nwhich gave them meaning.\n\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\nremoved from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\nshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion\nof people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\ndisgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\nlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so\ngreat, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\nrestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\nof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\nself-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\nRosings.\n\nTheir visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors\nleft them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her\nuncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\ninterest, but nothing to justify enquiry.\n\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,\nwould not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of\ntheir Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They\nhad nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if\nnot, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\nmarket-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,\nhowever, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the\nson of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\n\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good will which could not be\noverlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without\nany indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\ntheir two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion\nof her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a\nchange in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such\nits impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means\nunpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she\nesteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\n\nIt had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very\nday of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late\nbreakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\nher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with\nhow much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be\nrenewed.\n\nOn reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\n\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\nfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\nBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\nenquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.\n\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came.\n\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1181": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and\nabsurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that\ncorps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated\nelopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was\npossible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her\nbrother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.\n\nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.\n\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer\nabove-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their\ncarriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on\nElizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join\nher. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his\njudgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as\nto leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than\nlovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley\ncould not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to\nhis sister.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1182": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " she cried; ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1183": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1184": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " she rejoined, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1185": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\nsuccess she expected.

She could neither\nwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.

Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1207": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1208": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\none serious, parting, look, went away.\n\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\na hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\nof her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\nWickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.\n\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had\nnever been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\npromised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\nby one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled.

Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\n\nPoor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no\nworse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in\nlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,\ncould be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they\nhad feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they\nhad gained.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nMr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\nher husband, might then have rested in its proper place.\n\nHe was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any\none, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and\nhe was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his\nassistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\n\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\nhusband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\nincome.\n\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\nlatter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,\nthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within\nthat sum.\n\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to\nhave as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first\ntransports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were\nover, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was\nsoon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was\nquick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he\nwas indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any\nmessage to her.\n\nThe good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\nphilosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm\nhouse. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\nin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her\nmisery was considered certain.\n\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\nhappy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\nher wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\nproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\nimportance.\n\n", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1372": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " said she, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1373": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1374": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "\n\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\naffection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new\nclothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they\ntook place.\n\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the\nspot.\n\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\nbut at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's\nfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\ndisadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there\nseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\nobjection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the\nnearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\n\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\nshe could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they\nshould meet.\n\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\nhave been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\nthere must be a triumph.\n\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\n\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\nfamily.\n\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\nshe could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could\nbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions\nwere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\non quitting the Militia.\n\n     ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1375": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": " he added, ", "sel_type": "Quote"}, "1376": {"speaker": "", "speakee": [], "quote_type": "", "ref_exp": "", "text": "E.

Lady Catherine it\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\nLucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only\nset _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked\nforward to as possible, at some future time.\n\nIn revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\nan application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\n\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more.
